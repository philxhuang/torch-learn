<h1 style="text-align: center; font-size: 24px">Torch Learn, a Life-Long Learning Journey on ML</h1>

Torch Learn is my ongoing project that documents all the resources I have found useful, all the small projects I have built, and all the white papers I have
found interesting. This small project is meant for sharing with the rest of the academia and all beginners to Statistics & Machine Learning.

Feel free to fork and make your own. I only ask you give credit to where it is due.

**Happy learning.**

# Stage 0 - Python & Statistics
## Python Primer
- [x] [CMU 15-110 Priciples of Computing](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~15110/)
    - I have been a TA for this course, and I can attest to its effectiveness in teaching basic CS concepts in python. Begin with this if you have absolutely no programming experience.

- [x] [CMU 15-112 Fundamentals of Programming and Computer Science](http://www.krivers.net/15112-s19/)
    - 15-112 has a notorious/loved fame at CMU because of its rigorous content and great professors. Will be very challenging but will prepare you well.
